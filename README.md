# 💳 Banking Web Application (JavaScript)

A simulated banking web application built with vanilla JavaScript.

This project allows users to log in using a username and PIN, view their transaction history, transfer money to other accounts, request loans, and close their account.  
Transactions can also be sorted dynamically to improve readability and user experience.

The main goal of this project is to practice JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, array methods, and state management, without using any external frameworks.
